# WoW Blinker AddOn
  
Purpose
========================
AddOn approach of extracting any kind of in-game  
data from World of Warcraft. This is accomplished  
by setting up blinker nodes that go off when a  
certain event goes off in-game. Only one of ten  
blinkers is currently configured to be triggered  
on an event. By default the nodes are all green  
when there is no event triggered. If an event  
is triggered it will turn the blinker node red.  
For testing purposes the first node is programmed  
to go off as soon as your player hits 10% or less  
health.

Notes
========================
This AddOn can be configured to be triggered  
on a number of events that happen in game.  
Here a useful list off events that you can attach  
the nodes to in-game:

I didn't have the time to learn lua completely  
to make this AddOn, so the code will look like shit.  
It's very easy to expand on the code, whether you  
know lua or not.  
  
This is basically half of the work done.  
To truely make this useful, you will need an  
external program to read the color changes  
provided by the in-game nodes.  
  
__The rest is up to your imagination.__
